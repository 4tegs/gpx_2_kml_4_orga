## About
Convert GPX files exported from Garmin Basecamp in one go into a meaningful KML file that can be imported by Maps.me or Organic.Maps.

## Use:
### Planning: 
Planning is done in Garmin Basecamp. 
- Waypoints shall be named without special characters (ä/ö/ü etc)
- Waypoints may include a description
- Waypoints description may contain links
- Tracks shall be named without special characters (ä/ö/ü etc)
- Routes will not be considered as routes do not have reasonable track values.
- Export data via Basecamp File -> Export function.

### Conversion
GPX_2_KML_4_Orga has no user interface. You just take your exported GPX and drag & drop it onto the exe. As a result you have a converted KML with the same name in the same directory as the GPX.
If there are any errors, you will be informed.
